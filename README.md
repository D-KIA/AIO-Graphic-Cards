# AIO-Graphic-Cards

This program scraps the Graphic Card prices from Pc part selling sites and make a CSV file of it.
Just Run the 'main' and wait for it to scrape and then search.

The sites it scrapes are:-

                -Amazon 
                
                -MD Computer
                
                -PcShop
                
                -EasyShoppi
                
                -Vedant Computer
                
NOTE:- I use 'Selenium' for Amazon as it has a bot that prevent 'requests' from scraping it. Other than that I use 'requests' for all the others. 

(I am still working on an UI for the program)
